# VexNexa Tone of Voice Guide

## Document Purpose
This guide ensures all VexNexa content—website copy, documentation, support emails, blog posts, and social media—maintains a consistent, authentic voice that aligns with our brand positioning.

**Target Audience:** Content writers, marketers, product managers, support team, developers writing docs

---

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Technical (But Not Jargon-Heavy)

**What this means:**
We write for developers, agencies, and product teams who understand the web. We use accurate technical language but explain it clearly.

**We say:**
- "Scan against WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria"
- "axe-core detects violations in your HTML structure"
- "Our scanner renders JavaScript to test what users actually see"

**We don't say:**
- "Proprietary AI-powered deep learning algorithms"
- "Next-generation compliance engine"
- "Cutting-edge accessibility solutions"

**Why:**
Our audience values precision over marketing fluff. Use the correct technical term, then explain if needed.

---

### 2. Honest (Not Overpromising)

**What this means:**
We're transparent about what automated tools can and cannot do. We never make guarantees we can't keep.

**We say:**
- "Automated tools catch ~30-40% of accessibility issues"
- "We provide WCAG data; you're responsible for fixes"
- "No tool can guarantee legal compliance"

**We don't say:**
- "100% WCAG compliant in minutes"
- "Guaranteed lawsuit protection"
- "Certified accessible website"
- "Never worry about accessibility again"

**Why:**
Honesty builds trust. The accessibility community has been burned by false promises. We differentiate by being realistic.

---

### 3. Direct (Not Verbose)

**What this means:**
Say what you mean in as few words as necessary. Developers value their time.

**We say:**
- "Scan in seconds. Fix what matters."
- "No sales calls. Ever."
- "We scan your code. We don't inject widgets."

**We don't say:**
- "Leverage our innovative platform to optimize your digital accessibility strategy"
- "Embark on a transformative journey toward inclusive web experiences"
- "Synergize your compliance workflows with cutting-edge automation"

**Why:**
Clear, direct language respects the reader's time and intelligence.

---

### 4. Professional (Not Cute or Gimmicky)

**What this means:**
We're building a serious tool for professional use. Playful tone is fine in moderation, but credibility comes first.

**We say:**
- "VexNexa scans your site against WCAG standards"
- "Built for developers who care about accessibility"
- "Transparent pricing. Cancel anytime."

**We don't say:**
- "Whoops! Looks like your site has some boo-boos 😅"
- "Accessibility made fun!"
- "Say goodbye to boring compliance forever!"

**Why:**
Our users are professionals solving real problems. A professional tone matches the seriousness of accessibility.

---

### 5. Approachable (Not Condescending)

**What this means:**
We're experts, but we don't talk down to people. We explain things clearly without assuming everyone knows WCAG inside-out.

**We say:**
- "Color contrast measures how readable text is against its background"
- "ARIA attributes help screen readers understand interactive elements"
- "WCAG Level AA is the standard most organizations aim for"

**We don't say:**
- "Obviously, everyone knows WCAG 2.1.3..."
- "This is basic stuff, but..."
- "If you don't understand this, maybe you shouldn't be developing websites"

**Why:**
Accessibility is complex. People are learning. We should educate, not intimidate.

---

### 6. Transparent (Not Hiding Anything)

**What this means:**
We're upfront about pricing, limitations, and how things work. No fine print surprises.

**We say:**
- "Starter plan: 500 pages/month. Extra pages: €0.002 each."
- "API access coming Q1 2025 (not available yet)"
- "We use axe-core by Deque Systems for scanning"

**We don't say:**
- "Starting at just €19.99!" (hiding higher tiers or limits)
- "Advanced features available" (without explaining what or when)
- "Contact sales for pricing" (we show all prices upfront)

**Why:**
Transparency builds trust and aligns with our self-service philosophy.

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Use Active Voice

**Good:**
- "VexNexa scans your site in seconds"
- "We analyze your HTML structure"
- "You fix issues at the source"

**Bad:**
- "Your site is scanned by VexNexa"
- "HTML structure is analyzed"
- "Issues are fixed at the source"

**Why:** Active voice is more direct and engaging.

---

### Write in Second Person ("You")

**Good:**
- "When you scan your site, you'll see..."
- "Your accessibility score appears instantly"

**Bad:**
- "When users scan their sites, they will see..."
- "The accessibility score appears instantly"

**Why:** Second person creates connection and feels conversational.

---

### Use Short Sentences and Paragraphs

**Good:**
```
VexNexa scans your site against WCAG standards.
We show you exactly what's wrong.
You fix it in your code.
Simple.
```

**Bad:**
```
VexNexa provides comprehensive WCAG scanning capabilities that enable development teams to identify, prioritize, and remediate accessibility violations through an intuitive, user-friendly interface that streamlines the entire accessibility workflow.
```

**Why:** Short sentences are easier to scan and understand.

---

### Avoid Marketing Jargon

**Replace this** → **With this:**
- "Leverage" → "Use"
- "Solutions" → "Tools" or be specific (e.g., "scanner")
- "Innovative" → (Delete it. Show, don't tell.)
- "Cutting-edge" → (Delete it.)
- "Next-generation" → (Delete it.)
- "Empower" → "Help" or "Let you"
- "Transform" → "Improve" or "Change"
- "Revolutionary" → (Delete it.)
- "Seamless" → "Easy" or "Smooth"
- "Synergy" → (Never use this.)

---

### Be Specific, Not Vague

**Vague:**
- "Fast scanning"
- "Comprehensive reports"
- "Great support"

**Specific:**
- "Scans complete in 5-10 seconds"
- "Reports include element selectors, code snippets, and remediation guidance"
- "Email support responds within 24 hours (12 hours for Pro/Business plans)"

**Why:** Specific claims are more credible and useful.

---

### Use Contractions (When Appropriate)

**Good:**
- "We're building VexNexa for developers"
- "You'll see your score instantly"
- "It's not an overlay widget"

**Too formal:**
- "We are building VexNexa for developers"
- "You will see your score instantly"
- "It is not an overlay widget"

**Why:** Contractions sound more conversational and human.

---

## Topic-Specific Guidance

### When Writing About Accessibility Overlays

**Tone:** Professional, evidence-based, not aggressive

**Do:**
- Cite specific concerns from the accessibility community
- Explain technical reasons overlays fall short
- Acknowledge limited use cases where they might help
- Differentiate VexNexa's approach clearly

**Don't:**
- Attack overlay companies personally
- Use inflammatory language ("scam," "fraudulent," "evil")
- Claim overlays are NEVER useful (rare exceptions exist)
- Sound preachy or holier-than-thou

**Example:**
✅ "The accessibility community has raised concerns about overlays. We take a different approach: scanning your code instead of injecting widgets."

❌ "Overlay widgets are a scam and anyone using them is complicit in harming disabled users."

---

### When Writing About WCAG Compliance

**Tone:** Honest and educational, not fear-mongering

**Do:**
- Explain what WCAG levels mean (A, AA, AAA)
- Be clear about what automated tools can/can't detect
- Encourage manual testing
- Avoid promising compliance

**Don't:**
- Promise "guaranteed compliance"
- Suggest VexNexa alone makes a site accessible
- Use scare tactics about lawsuits
- Oversimplify complex WCAG concepts

**Example:**
✅ "VexNexa helps you identify WCAG violations. Fixing them is an important step toward accessibility, but manual testing is also essential."

❌ "Get WCAG compliant now or risk expensive lawsuits! VexNexa guarantees your safety."

---

### When Writing About Pricing

**Tone:** Transparent, straightforward, no games

**Do:**
- Show all prices upfront
- Explain what's included at each tier
- Clearly state overflow pricing
- Mention "cancel anytime" prominently

**Don't:**
- Hide pricing behind "contact sales"
- Use bait-and-switch tactics
- Bury limitations in fine print
- Pressure with fake urgency ("Only 3 spots left!")

**Example:**
✅ "Starter plan: €19.99/month. 1 site, 500 pages/month. Extra pages: €0.002 each. Cancel anytime."

❌ "Starting from €19.99! Contact us for full details and custom enterprise pricing."

---

### When Writing About Competitors

**Tone:** Respectful comparison, not trash-talking

**Do:**
- Acknowledge legitimate use cases for other tools
- Compare specific features objectively
- Explain our different approach
- Let readers decide what's best for them

**Don't:**
- Insult competitors
- Make unverifiable claims about their products
- Spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt)
- Name-drop unnecessarily

**Example:**
✅ "Enterprise platforms like Siteimprove offer robust features but require demos and long contracts. VexNexa is self-service and transparent."

❌ "Siteimprove is bloated, overpriced garbage. VexNexa is infinitely better in every way."

---

### When Writing Support Content

**Tone:** Helpful, patient, clear

**Do:**
- Answer the question directly
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Link to relevant documentation
- Acknowledge when something is confusing

**Don't:**
- Make users feel stupid
- Use "just" dismissively (e.g., "just click here")
- Blame the user for issues
- Give vague answers

**Example:**
✅ "To export a PDF report, click the 'Export' button in the top right of your scan results, then choose 'PDF.' The download will start automatically."

❌ "Just export it. It's obvious if you look."

---

## Brand Voice Examples

### Homepage Hero

**Aligned with brand voice:**
> **Instant accessibility audits. No overlays. No sales calls.**
>
> Fast WCAG scanning for developers and agencies who need real data, not widget band-aids.

**Why it works:**
- Direct and clear
- Honest (no overpromising)
- Technical but accessible language
- Differentiates immediately (no overlays, no sales calls)

---

### Feature Description

**Aligned with brand voice:**
> **Developer-Friendly Reports**
>
> Every violation includes what's wrong, why it matters, how to fix it, and which WCAG criterion it violates. No vague scores. Just data you can act on.

**Why it works:**
- Specific about what's included
- "No vague scores" = honest differentiation
- "Data you can act on" = respects developer intelligence

---

### Pricing Copy

**Aligned with brand voice:**
> **Transparent pricing. No surprises.**
>
> Start free. Upgrade when you're ready. Cancel anytime. No contracts. No "contact sales."

**Why it works:**
- Direct promises
- Transparent about business model
- Clear contrast with competitors ("no contact sales")

---

### Error Message

**Aligned with brand voice:**
> **Scan failed**
>
> We couldn't load https://example.com. This might be because:
> - The site is down or unreachable
> - It blocks our scanner's user agent
> - A firewall is blocking our requests
>
> Try again in a few minutes. If the problem persists, [contact support](/support).

**Why it works:**
- Honest about failure
- Explains possible causes clearly
- Offers next steps
- Professional but not cold

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Over-Selling

**Bad example:**
> "VexNexa's revolutionary AI-powered accessibility engine transforms your website into a fully compliant, legally protected, WCAG-certified masterpiece in just seconds!"

**Why it's bad:**
- Overpromising (revolutionary, transform, fully compliant, legally protected)
- AI hype without substance
- Unrealistic timeline ("seconds" for full compliance)

**Better:**
> "VexNexa scans your site against WCAG standards in seconds. We show you what's wrong so you can fix it properly."

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Being Vague

**Bad example:**
> "Advanced accessibility features coming soon!"

**Why it's bad:**
- What features?
- How soon?
- Why should I care?

**Better:**
> "Coming in Q1 2025: API access, scheduled scans, and multi-site dashboards. [See roadmap →](/roadmap)"

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Talking Down to Users

**Bad example:**
> "Even a beginner can understand VexNexa's simple interface. If you've ever used a website before, you'll figure it out!"

**Why it's bad:**
- Condescending tone
- Implies users might not have basic skills
- Defensive about simplicity

**Better:**
> "VexNexa's interface is straightforward: paste a URL, click scan, review results. No training required."

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Corporate Speak

**Bad example:**
> "VexNexa delivers synergistic accessibility solutions that empower stakeholders to leverage best-in-class WCAG compliance frameworks across enterprise-grade digital ecosystems."

**Why it's bad:**
- Meaningless buzzwords
- Says nothing concrete
- Alienates developers who value clarity

**Better:**
> "VexNexa scans websites for WCAG violations. You get detailed reports. You fix the issues. Simple."

---

### ❌ Pitfall 5: False Urgency

**Bad example:**
> "🔥 LIMITED TIME: Only 5 spots left in our beta program! Sign up NOW before it's too late! ⏰"

**Why it's bad:**
- Creates artificial pressure
- Feels scammy
- Undermines trust

**Better:**
> "We're running a beta program for upcoming features. Interested? [Join the waitlist →](/beta)"

---

## Tone Variations by Context

### Marketing Pages (Homepage, Features, Pricing)
**Tone:** Confident, clear, slightly persuasive (but never pushy)

**Example:**
> "No sales calls. No overlays. Just instant WCAG insights."

---

### Documentation & Help Articles
**Tone:** Instructional, patient, thorough

**Example:**
> "To schedule a recurring scan, navigate to your site settings and click 'Schedule Scans.' Choose your frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly), then save."

---

### Support Emails
**Tone:** Helpful, empathetic, solution-oriented

**Example:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! I see the scan failed because the site requires authentication. We're adding this feature in Q2 2025. For now, you could scan a publicly accessible staging environment. Let me know if that helps!"

---

### Blog Posts
**Tone:** Educational, authoritative (but not arrogant), conversational

**Example:**
> "Automated accessibility scanning is powerful, but it's not magic. In this post, we'll break down exactly what tools like VexNexa can and can't detect—and why manual testing still matters."

---

### Social Media
**Tone:** Casual, human, engaging (but still professional)

**Example (Twitter/X):**
> "Hot take: 'Just install this widget' is not an accessibility strategy. Scan your code. Fix the issues. Build it right. 🛠️"

---

### Error Messages
**Tone:** Clear, non-blaming, actionable

**Example:**
> "Page not found. The URL you're looking for doesn't exist. Check the address or [return home](/)."

---

## Inclusive Language Guidelines

### Refer to People First

**Good:**
- "People with disabilities"
- "Blind users"
- "Deaf users"
- "Users with motor impairments"

**Avoid:**
- "The disabled"
- "Handicapped users"
- "Wheelchair-bound" (say "wheelchair users")

---

### Avoid Ableist Language

**Replace this** → **With this:**
- "Blind spot" → "Gap" or "oversight"
- "Crippled by" → "Severely limited by"
- "Lame" → "Weak" or "unconvincing"
- "Crazy idea" → "Bold idea" or "wild idea"
- "Insane" → "Extreme" or "unbelievable"

---

### Don't Use Disability as Metaphor

**Avoid:**
- "Turn a blind eye to accessibility"
- "Deaf to user feedback"
- "Crippling technical debt"

**Better:**
- "Ignore accessibility"
- "Unresponsive to user feedback"
- "Severe technical debt"

---

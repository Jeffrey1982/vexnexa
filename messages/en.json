      "q1": {
        "question": "Can you guarantee legal compliance?",
        "answer": "No tool can guarantee 100% legal compliance in all contexts. VexNexa detects and reports issues, assists remediation, and helps you adhere to WCAG and related standards. For legal risk assessment, consider an expert audit and ongoing governance process."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How do page limits work?",
        "answer": "Each plan includes a monthly page scan limit. A 'page' is one URL scanned. If you scan the same page multiple times in a month, each scan counts toward your limit. When you approach your limit, you'll receive a notification."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What if I exceed my plan?",
        "answer": "Free Trial: Service is blocked at limit. Upgrade to a paid plan to continue scanning. Paid plans: Service continues but you'll receive notifications to upgrade if you consistently exceed your limits."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do you support teams/SSO?",
        "answer": "Pro plans support up to 5 team members. Business plans support up to 15 members with role-based access. SSO is available on Business and Enterprise plans. Contact us for Enterprise features."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I export reports?",
        "answer": "PDF export is available on all paid plans. Word export is available on Pro and Business plans. All exports include your scan results, prioritized issues, code snippets, and remediation recommendations."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What's monitored continuously?",
        "answer": "Continuous monitoring allows you to schedule automatic scans (daily, weekly, or monthly). You'll receive email alerts when scores drop or new issues are detected. This feature is available on Pro and Business plans."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Do I need to schedule a demo?",
        "answer": "No! VexNexa is 100% self-serve. Sign up, enter your URL, and get your accessibility report in minutes. We don't offer demos or sales calls."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Is VexNexa an accessibility overlay?",
        "answer": "No. We scan your code structure and give you WCAG violations to fix properly. We never inject widgets or scripts into your site. Overlays are controversial in the accessibility community—we analyze your actual code instead."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "Can VexNexa automatically fix issues?",
        "answer": "No. Real accessibility requires proper code changes. We show you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it, but you need to make the changes yourself. Automated 'fixes' don't address root causes."

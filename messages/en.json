      "q2": {
        "question": "How do page limits work?",
        "answer": "Each plan includes a monthly page scan limit. A 'page' is one URL scanned. If you scan the same page multiple times in a month, each scan counts toward your limit. When you approach your limit, you'll receive a notification."

        "question": "Do you support teams/SSO?",

        "question": "Can I export reports?",

      "q6": {
        "question": "What's monitored continuously?",

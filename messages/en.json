      "q1": {
        "question": "Can you guarantee legal compliance?",
        "answer": "No tool can guarantee 100% legal compliance in all contexts. TutusPorta detects and reports issues, assists remediation, and helps you adhere to WCAG and related standards. For legal risk assessment, consider an expert audit and ongoing governance process."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How do page limits work?",
        "answer": "Each plan includes a monthly page scan limit. A 'page' is one URL scanned. If you scan the same page multiple times in a month, each scan counts toward your limit. When you approach your limit, you'll receive a notification."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What if I exceed my plan?",
        "answer": "Small overages are automatically billed at €0.002/page, €2/extra site, or €1/extra user per month. When you consistently exceed limits, we'll suggest upgrading to a more suitable plan."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do you support teams/SSO?",

      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I export reports?",
        "answer": "PDF export is available on all paid plans. Word export is available on Pro and Business plans. All exports include your scan results, prioritized issues, code snippets, and remediation recommendations."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What's monitored continuously?",
        "answer": "Continuous monitoring allows you to schedule automatic scans (daily, weekly, or monthly). You'll receive email alerts when scores drop or new issues are detected. This feature is available on Pro and Business plans."

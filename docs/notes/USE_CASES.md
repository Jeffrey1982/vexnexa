## Page Metadata
**URL**: /for-saas
**Title**: Accessibility Scanning for SaaS Products | VexNexa
**Meta Description**: Ship accessible features fast. Integrate WCAG scanning into your SaaS development workflow with VexNexa's developer-friendly reports and upcoming API.

---

## Hero Section

### Headline
**Ship accessible features. Without slowing down.**

### Subheadline

## The SaaS Challenge

You're shipping features weekly (or daily). Accessibility can't be an afterthought, but it also can't block releases.

**Common SaaS accessibility problems:**
- New features introduce accessibility regressions
- Design system components aren't consistently accessible
- Manual testing doesn't scale with rapid iteration
- No clear ownership between design, dev, and QA
- Unclear WCAG requirements for international markets

**What you need:**
- Automated scanning that catches issues early
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines
- Developer-friendly reports, not vague compliance scores
- Ability to track trends across releases

---

## How SaaS Teams Use VexNexa

### 1. Feature Development
**Scenario:** Developer building a new dashboard component.

**VexNexa workflow:**
1. Build component on staging
2. Scan staging URL before PR review
3. Catch accessibility issues early (color contrast, keyboard nav)
4. Fix before merge
5. Re-scan to verify

**Result:** Accessibility bugs caught in dev, not production.

---

### 2. Release QA
**Scenario:** Weekly release cycle, need to verify accessibility didn't regress.

**VexNexa workflow:**
1. Scan production before release
2. Scan staging after new features merged
3. Compare results (coming soon: built-in comparison view)
4. Flag any new violations
5. Block release if critical issues found

**Result:** Confidence that accessibility isn't degrading over time.

---

### 3. Design System Audits
**Scenario:** Standardizing components across product.

**VexNexa workflow:**
1. Create test pages for each component (buttons, forms, modals, etc.)
2. Scan each component in isolation
3. Document WCAG compliance per component
4. Fix issues at design system level
5. Cascade fixes across entire product

**Result:** Accessible design system = accessible product.

---

### 4. Competitive Analysis
**Scenario:** Evaluating your accessibility vs. competitors.

**VexNexa workflow:**
1. Scan your key pages
2. Scan competitor pages
3. Compare WCAG compliance scores
4. Identify gaps and opportunities
5. Use data in product/marketing positioning

**Result:** Accessibility as a competitive advantage.

---

## SaaS-Specific Features

### API Access (Coming Q1 2025)

```

**Use cases:**
- Automated nightly scans
- PR checks (fail build if critical violations found)

- Webhook triggers to Slack/Jira

### Developer-Friendly Reports
Every violation includes:
- Specific element selector (CSS/XPath)

**No fluff. Just data.**

## Pricing for SaaS Teams

- 5,000 pages/month (enough for most SaaS apps)
- 5 team members (frontend, design, QA, PM, eng lead)
- Scheduled scans (coming soon)
- API access (coming soon)

### For Larger Teams: Business Plan - €99.99/month
**Best for scaling SaaS companies:**
- 10 sites (multiple products, environments, locales)

### Overflow Pricing
Transparent costs for high-traffic products:

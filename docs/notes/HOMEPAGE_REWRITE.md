## 🚫 What VexNexa Is NOT

### Section Headline
**Let's be clear about what we don't do**

### Anti-Feature 1
**We're not an overlay widget**
We don't inject scripts into your site. We analyze your code and give you real WCAG violations to fix properly.

### Anti-Feature 2
**We're not a legal guarantee**
We provide technical data, not litigation protection. No tool can guarantee you won't be sued.

### Anti-Feature 3
**We're not an automated fixer**
We show you what's wrong so you can fix it at the source. Real accessibility requires real code changes.

### Anti-Feature 4
**We're not enterprise bloatware**
No mandatory demos. No year-long contracts. No "contact sales." Just transparent self-service.
